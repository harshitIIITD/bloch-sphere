# Interactive Bloch Sphere Visualization with Flask

This project demonstrates an interactive Bloch sphere visualization using Flask, Plotly, and NumPy. 

## About the Bloch Sphere

The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of a qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information. It's a crucial tool for visualizing and understanding the state of a qubit. This project provides an interactive
 web-based interface for exploring the Bloch sphere.

## Features

- Interactive 3D Bloch sphere visualization using Plotly.
- Dynamically update the qubit state.
- Intuitive controls for manipulating the qubit.
- Built with Flask for a user-friendly web interface.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
- bash git clone <repository_url>


2. **Navigate to the project directory
:**
bash cd BLOCH-SPHERE

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
- bash python3 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate

4. **Install dependencies:**
- bash pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**
- bash python app.py

or

- bash ./devserver.sh

2. **Open your web browser and visit:**
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Usage

- **Interact with the Bloch sphere:** Use your mouse to rotate and zoom the sphere.
- **Modify the qubit state:** Adjust the controls to change the qubit's state and observe its representation on the sphere.
